Thomsen, P.F., Møller, P.R., Sigsgaard, E.E., Knudsen, S.W., Jørgensen, O.A. and Willerslev, E., 2016. Environmental DNA from seawater samples correlate with trawl catches of subarctic, deepwater fishes. PloS one, 11(11), p.e0165252.

This paper shows a strong agreement between species composition found by trawling and eDNA sequencing. They use 12sRNA and despite using a blocking primer to prevent human DNA the most common contaminants seen were still human.
